This repository contains a set of example scripts for the Airlock Gateway REST interface. The scripts are not part of the official Airlock product delivery and Ergon/Airlock does not provide support for it. Best effort support may be provided by the contributor of the script.

As the name of the repository suggest, the scripts are **examples** and should be treated as such. Further, most scripts are independent of each other, do not provide a consistent level of quality and have no library characteristic.
