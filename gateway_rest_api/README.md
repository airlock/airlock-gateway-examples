# Airlock Gateway REST API Example Scripts (MOVED)

**Please Note: The REST API example scripts previously hosted in this repository have been moved.**

The scripts formerly contained here have been relocated to the `examples` directory within the `airlock-gateway-rest-api-lib-py` repository. This move centralizes the examples alongside the Python library they utilize, providing a more cohesive structure as all scripts are based on this library.

**You can find the scripts in their new location:**
